the guess_two_thirds app has a particular wait page in which players can play a game of pong against a computer while waiting for other players to complete the task. this is probably best used for tasks that might take some players more time than others. there are clearly downsides to using this as it may take attention away from the experiment at hand. however, it might be an alternative to players using their phone during an experiment
